# Install and usage
We developed this project in Eclipse. 

To play the game you first need to import the project into your editor. This can be done through cloning this github page, or to import the */qwirkle* directory.
Now it depends on what you want to run. If you want to run the server,you need to excecute the *server.java* file in the package *nl.utwente.ewi.qwirkle.server.connect*.
If you want to run the client, you need to run the *QwirkleClient.java* in the package *nl.utwente.ewi.qwirkle.client*.

In the *QwirkleClient.java* you can also change between a GUI and TUI view, this by changing the instance in *line 56* from GUIView() - TUIView().

Everything should be understandable from the screen on what kind of input is asked.
